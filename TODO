why are we getting duplicates in the results? this is very concerning
multiple salts
	[done]fed from a file (like plaintexts) OR from the hash as it it comes in
	[done]rewrite code to not use hashdb for salted hash algos (mscache and crypt)
[done]mscache
[done]crypt
[done]threaded
	[done]even when rnpc->num_threads = 0, it = 1
	[done]create rnpc_thread_t
	[done]- mangle = threadsafe
	[done]- salt = threadsafe
	[done]- brute = threadsafe
	try to avoid cache hits for threads
		[done]threads local cache words from dict
	why is non-mangled attack so much slower (because of cache hits)
[done]passwords from stdin
dictionary needs "linked list" mode
"masked" passwords
networked
